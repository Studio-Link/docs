## How it works

Each "Studio Link" client is assigned a unique phone number which is displayed under "Your ID" (e.g. 1234568@studio.link).
This unique phone number allows the client to be dialed or reached from outside like a traditional telephone number,
except that it is structured like an email address. This phone number is permanently assigned to the client upon first 
use and will always remain the same.

::: info PAID Option
Furthermore, users have the option to assign a desired number to a client via the paid function 
(e.g. podcast@studio.link). This allows for greater customization and branding options for users.

For example, if you are a podcaster who wants to interview a guest who is located in a different city or country, 
you can use Studio Link to establish a remote audio connection between your computer and your guest's computer or mobile device. 
Each of you would need to have the Studio Link software installed and set up as a "client" with a unique phone number. 
Once the connection is established, you can record the conversation in high-quality audio, as if you were in the same room.

::: info PAID Option
With [Studio Link - QuickWeb](/quickweb) you can invite guests browser only (This means that guests do not need to download or
install any additional software, but can simply join the session using a link provided by the host).
